Recently, I passed the Professional Scrum Developer I (PSD I) certification from Scrum.org. But that's the main reason why I'm posting today.

While preparing for the exam, I stumbled across an open-source initiative by Ditectrev with a big pool of questions that should help you prepare for the exam.

I vibe-coded a web interface on top of their 300+ question collection that will allow you to practice with instant feedback, take timed exam simulations, bookmark difficult questions for review, and track your progress with detailed analytics—all with keyboard navigation and randomized options to prevent memorization.

The tool includes:
✅ Practice Mode - Study at your own pace with immediate feedback
✅ Exam Mode - Realistic 60-minute exam simulation with random80 questions
✅ Smart Bookmarking - Flag and review challenging questions
✅ Progress Tracking - Monitor your performance and improvement

The project is open-source and available on GitHub. If you're preparing for the PSD I exam, feel free to check it out!
